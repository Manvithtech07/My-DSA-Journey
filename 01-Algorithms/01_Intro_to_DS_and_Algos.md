# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is a Data Structure?

A **Data Structure** is a systematic way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer's memory so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. The choice of data structure determines how data is stored and the operations that can be performed on it.

* **Examples:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs.

## What is an Algorithm?

An **Algorithm** is a finite, well-defined sequence of steps or instructions designed to solve a specific problem or perform a computation. It takes a set of inputs and produces a desired output.

* **Characteristics of a good algorithm:**
    * **Input:** It has zero or more well-defined inputs.
    * **Output:** It produces at least one well-defined output.
    * **Finiteness:** It must terminate after a finite number of steps.
    * **Definiteness:** Each step must be clear and unambiguous.
    * **Effectiveness:** Every instruction must be basic enough to be carried out.
